# Ao3 Tag Manager
Chrome browser extension to manage tags for your works on **Archive of Our Own**. Change order of tags, delete them or add new to your works. 
**The extension for now only supports already posted works.**

## How does it work?
 1. Existing work tags are placed in the extension, where they can be modified - reordered or deleted. It is also possible to add new tags by hand.
 3. By clicking "Save and Post", the extension first deletes tags and post the work without them. Then it refills the work with the modified tags and post the work again. The whole process happens in a fraction of a second. 
4. Since the extension is in the early stage we STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO BACKUP YOUR EXISTING TAGS BEFORE USING IT. **Take a screenshot of your tags or write them down before using the extension.** 

## Room for improvement
 - Saving tags for new works and drafts
 - Hints when entering new tags
 - Editing existing tags within extension
 - Support for other browsers
